# Pool: OpenAI (ChatGPT subscription) model routing — Design

**Date:** 2026-07-08
**Status:** Approved design, pending implementation plan

## Goal

Let a single Claude Code session, pointed at the pool (`ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`),
use OpenAI models mid-session via Claude Code's `/model` custom-model entry —
e.g. plan on a Claude model, then switch to a GPT model for cheaper build work.
The pool routes those requests to OpenAI's Codex backend using **ChatGPT
subscription OAuth accounts** (the same auth the Codex CLI uses), and
load-balances/fails over across multiple such accounts exactly as it does for
Claude Max/Team accounts today.

**Out of scope (explicitly):** OpenAI platform API keys as an upstream. The
user only uses ChatGPT subscription auth. No API-key pool, no Chat Completions
upstream target.

## How it fits the existing architecture

Today `POST /v1/messages` unconditionally routes to `proxyAnthropicMessages`
(direct Anthropic OAuth upstream). The change: branch on `body.model` first.

```
POST /v1/messages
  │
  ├─ model in OpenAI model table? ──> OpenAI account pool
  │                                     upstream/openai-codex.ts
  │                                     (Anthropic Messages ⇄ Codex Responses API)
  └─ else ─────────────────────────> existing Claude account pool (unchanged)
```

Claude Code always speaks Anthropic Messages protocol to the pool; the new
upstream adapter translates request and (streamed) response between Anthropic
Messages and OpenAI's Responses API shape used by the Codex backend. This is
the same trick claude-code-router performs, done natively inside the pool so
one endpoint carries both providers with one dashboard and one failover story.

## Components

### 1. Account model: provider-tagged accounts

Each account directory under `~/.claude-max-pool/accounts/<name>/` gains a
`provider` marker (`"anthropic"` default, or `"openai"`). OpenAI accounts
store the Codex OAuth credential set (access token, refresh token, expiry,
account/plan info — the contents of Codex's `auth.json`) instead of Claude's
`.credentials.json`.

`AccountManager` becomes provider-aware:
- `pick(sessionKey, provider)` selects only from accounts of the requested
  provider.
- Session stickiness is keyed per provider: `(sessionKey, provider) → account`.
  A Claude Code session that switches `/model` between providers mid-session
  holds one pin per provider, so its GPT requests keep hitting the same
  ChatGPT subscription while its Claude requests keep hitting the same Claude
  account. Stickiness matters especially for OpenAI: the Codex backend caches
  prompts server-side per account, so re-routing a live session to another sub
  re-ingests the whole conversation (slower, wastes window headroom). Pins
  break only when the pinned account becomes unavailable (cooldown / auth
  failure), matching existing behavior.
- Token refresh dispatches per provider (Anthropic OAuth token endpoint vs.
  OpenAI's OAuth token endpoint, as used by the Codex CLI refresh flow).
- Usage counters, stickiness, cooldown, and persistence are shared logic.

### 2. Auth / account setup CLI

Same UX as today, extended with a provider flag:

```sh
bro accounts login work --provider openai   # ChatGPT OAuth browser flow
bro accounts list                            # one table, both providers
bro accounts remove work
```

The login flow implements the Codex OAuth (PKCE browser) flow directly —
the same flow the Codex CLI and third-party tools (Cline, OpenCode plugin)
use — and writes the credential set into the account dir. An `import` variant
can copy an existing `~/.codex/auth.json`.

**Note:** OpenAI positions subscription OAuth for individual interactive use;
pooling your own personal accounts is the same posture as the existing Claude
pool. Not for resale/multi-user service.

### 3. Upstream adapter: `pool/src/upstream/openai-codex.ts`

Parallel to `upstream/anthropic.ts`. Responsibilities:

- Ensure the account's Codex access token is fresh (refresh via OAuth refresh
  token, persist rotated tokens back to the account dir).
- Translate the incoming Anthropic Messages body → Codex Responses API
  request: system prompt, message history, tool definitions/results, streaming
  flag, model id (mapped through the model table).
- POST to the Codex backend endpoint with the account's bearer token.
- Translate the response back to Anthropic Messages shape:
  - Non-stream: full Responses object → Anthropic message JSON with usage.
  - Stream: Responses SSE events → Anthropic Messages SSE events
    (`message_start`, `content_block_delta`, tool_use blocks, `message_delta`
    with usage, `message_stop`).
- Translation fidelity requirements: text, tool use (Claude Code is
  tool-heavy — this must be lossless), stop reasons, token usage. Images/
  extended thinking are best-effort; unsupported features degrade gracefully
  rather than erroring.

### 4. Rate-limit snapshots and routing

Codex backend responses carry primary/secondary rate-limit window info
(used-percent + reset; a ~5-hour window and a weekly window — this is what
powers `codex /status`). This maps nearly 1:1 onto the existing
`RateLimitSnapshot` (5h / 7d unified windows), so:

- Parse those headers/fields on every Codex response into the same snapshot
  structure.
- Least-headroom routing and 429/limit-triggered cooldown + failover reuse the
  existing machinery (`failover.ts`, `markRateLimited`).
- Exact header/field names to be verified against a live Codex response during
  implementation (do not trust docs blindly).

### 5. Model table + `bro models update`

A model routing table replaces the hardcoded `MODELS` array as the source for
`/v1/models` and for the provider branch:

- `bro models update` queries each provider's upstream model list (the Codex
  backend's available models for OpenAI accounts; the static Claude list for
  Anthropic) and writes a cache (e.g. `~/.claude-max-pool/models.json`).
- Each entry: `{ id, provider, upstreamModel }` — `id` is what you type into
  Claude Code's `/model` custom entry (e.g. `gpt-5.6`), `upstreamModel` is the
  real model id sent upstream.
- The pool loads the cache at startup and on change; unknown model ids fall
  through to the Anthropic path (today's behavior).

### 6. Dashboard

`/api/status` and the dashboard list OpenAI accounts alongside Claude ones:
provider badge, auth state, plan, both rate-limit windows' utilization, rolling
usage. Failover log lines already name accounts; no change needed there.

## Error handling

- No available OpenAI account for an OpenAI-model request → 503 with an
  Anthropic-shaped `overloaded_error` (mirrors existing behavior).
- Codex token refresh failure → account marked unauthenticated, request fails
  over to another OpenAI account if any, else 503.
- Translation encountering an unsupported Anthropic feature → strip with a
  server log line, never a hard error mid-stream.
- Codex upstream 401/403 → mark account unauthenticated; 429/limit event →
  cooldown + failover (existing semantics).

## Testing

- Unit: request/response translation fixtures (Anthropic body ⇄ Codex
  Responses, stream event mapping, tool-use round-trips) — pure functions,
  same style as `upstream/anthropic.test.ts`.
- Unit: provider-aware `AccountManager.pick`, Codex token refresh persistence,
  rate-limit snapshot parsing.
- Integration (manual): live Codex account — verify a Claude Code session can
  `/model gpt-…`, stream a tool-using turn, and observe failover between two
  accounts by forcing a cooldown.

## Non-goals

- OpenAI platform API keys as an upstream.
- Other providers (Gemini, etc.) — though the provider-tagged account +
  upstream-adapter seam is the extension point if ever wanted.
- Replacing the ccr-based non-pool providers in bro's main menu.
